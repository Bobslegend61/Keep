### VARIABLES, IF, ELSE, WHILE

#### Keywords and Identifiers

- ##### Keywords
  Keywords are a set of words reserved for use only by the program. This words are not to be used as **_Identifiers_** by the developer. Some examples of keywords includes:
  ```c
    let, const, do, for, while, int, char, double, long, unsigned, case, union, enum
  ```
- ##### Identifiers

These are names given to variables, functions, enums etc..
The maximum length comparable by the C standard is 31. This means if i name two variables 34 characters long and the first 31 characters are the same, then C reads this as the same variables without taking into account the remaining 2. Though the comparable length can be increased by the C developer.

#### Types

There are basically two types in C, `real` and `integral` types.

1. `Real Types`
